					Why do I take photos?
					</div>
				</div>
				Why do I like photography? I don't know how to answer that question myself. Even though I'm the one who is asking myself that question...

				I started taking photos because of drawing. I wanted to get references so if I ever had the urge to draw it, I'd have a picture of it. Though, sometimes I find myself taking photos without the thought of it being a reference in my head. I don't know what draws me to photography. I just do it because I want to. I don't know what fuels that fire though.

					Why do I need an expensive camera?

				</div>
			I don't need an expensive camera. I really don't. Although, I am a perfectionist when it comes to certain things and that can affect my work. It irritates me when my drawings or pictures aren't perfect or don't come out the way I want them to whether it be color or style. I used to have an iPhone. Personally, I don't like them. My pictures looked terrible and it irritated me. So, my mother asked me if I wanted her phone because she was getting a new one. I took her Samsung. It is better in my opinion or maybe I just had a bad iPhone. Although, it still didn't please me. Talk about picky. So, I asked for a camera. I was talking about how I wanted to buy one that was under $100, but my parents wouldn't let me. They wouldn't let me because they bought me a camera for my birthday. I love using it and seeing how my pictures turn out so well. Not a blur to be seen.

					Why don't I take a media arts class? 
					</div>
				</div>
			
Honestly, a media arts class did interest me before. When I was in grade 8 I was thinking about taking the class for grade 9 but now, I don't feel drawn to taking a photography class. I don't know how much I'm interested in photography. I don't know if it's worth giving up a class that focuses on a passion I know I have such as drawing or even dance. I don't go out and take pictures every day. It's more like once a week or not even. I actually don't go out just to take photos. I don't like going outside often so the only time I'd take photos is when I'm forced to go out. Some of my pictures are from Grouse Mountain but I didn't want to go there. I'd preferred I was at home. Though, I had no choice. So, instead of being grumpy the whole time, I took photos of whatever caught my eye.

I don't do stuff or go out just for the purpose of taking photos. That's why I don't want to take a media arts class.
