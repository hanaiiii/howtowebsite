			What is my aesthetic?
			</div>
			<div class="reason">
			I don't know if I have an aesthetic yet. I'm not that drawn to photography yet. I seem to just take a picture of whatever catches my eye whether it be nature, people or just a random object. I don't know what catches my eye exactly. Am I into dark things? Am I into pink things? I have no idea. I don't know if I consider photography as a hobby or a passion quite yet. Maybe that's why I don't know what I like taking photos of.
